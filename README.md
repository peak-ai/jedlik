# Jedlik

![Jedinak](assets/jedinak.jpg)

Jedlik is an extensible DynamoDB ODM for Node, written in TypeScript.

Jedlik allows you to utilize the power of JavaScript classes to create models of entities in your domain, while introducing behaviour that allows you to interact with DynamoDB in a simple way.

## Install

Yarn:
`yarn add @peak-ai/jedlik`
NPM:
`npm i -S @peak-ai/jedlik`

Unstable releases are published as `develop` - e.g. `yarn add @peak-ai/jedlik@develop`

## Usage

```ts
import * as jedlik from '@peak-ai/jedlik';

interface UserProps {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  type: 'admin' | 'user';
}

// the name of the DynamoDB table the model should write to
// it is assumed this table exists
const Users = new jedlik.Model<UserProps>({ table: 'users' });

const user = Users.create({ id: 1, name: 'Fred' }); // create a new document locally

await user.save(); // write the data to the database

user.set({ name: 'Ronak' }); // update an attribute locally

console.log(user.get('name')) // get an attribute

Users.on('save', (u) => {
  console.log(u.toObject()); // get the attributes as a plain object
});

await user.save(); // write the changes to the database

const user2 = await Users.get({ id: 2 }); // query the database

console.log(user2.toObject());

// advanced filtering
const admins = await Users.scan({
  filters: { key: 'type', operator: '=', value: 'admin' },
});
```

## API

### `class Model<T>`

#### `constructor(options: ModelOptions, config?: DatabaseOptions): Model<T>`

Constructor function that creates a new `Model`.

##### options.table (String - required)

Name of the DynamoDB table to interact with

##### `config`

Optional config that is passed directly to the underlying [`AWS.DynamoDB` service constructor from the AWS SDK.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/DynamoDB.html#constructor-property)

#### `Model.create(item: T): Document<T>`

Returns a new `Document` using the attributes of the given item.

#### `Model.query(key: Key<T>, options?: QueryOptions<T>): Promise<Document<T>[]>`

Resolves with an array of items which match the given key. Takes an optional index parameter to query against a secondary index.
Returned items are instances of the model.

#### `Model.first(key: Key<T>, options? FirstOptions<T>): Promise<Document<T>>`

Convenience method which returns the first item found by the `Model.query` method, or null if no items are found.

#### `Model.get(key: Key<T>) : Promise<Document<T>>`

Resolves with the item that matches the given key parameter.

**N.B.** The key must be the full primary key defined in the table schema. If the table has a composite key, both the partition key and sort key must be provided. You cannot search on a secondary index. If you need to do one of these, use `Model.query` or `Model.first` instead.

#### `Model.delete(key: Key<T>): Promise<void>`

Deletes the item that matches the given key parameter.

#### `Model.on(eventName: EventName, callback: (document?: Document<T>) => void): void`

Registers an event handler to be fired after successful events. Valid event names are `delete` and `save`.

### `class Document<T>`

A `Document` represents a single item in your DynamoDB table.

#### `Document.get(key: keyof T): T[K]`

Returns the value of an attribute on the document.

#### `Document.set(props: Partial<T>): void`

Sets the value of an attribute on the document.

#### `Document.save(): Promise<void>`

Saves the Documents attributes to DynamoDB, either overwriting the existing item with the given primary key, or creating a new one.

#### `Document.toObject(): T`

Returns a plain JavaScript object representation of the documents attributes.

## Roadmap

Some features that I'd still like to add

- Support for more complicated filter types - [the full list is here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)
- Add schemas to provide things like default values, required fields, and validation - original Jedlik had something like this
- Ability to add methods to Documents and Models
- Ability to add "virtual properties" to documents - like getters
- Timestamps
- Key validation. For example - You should only be able to pass key properties into `Model.get`. And you shouldn't really be able to update the key properties on a document - if you change the value of a key property of an existing document, a new document will be created. We should make this better, even if it's just by adding better type checking. Currently when you need to give a key, it just uses `Partial<T>` as the type.

## Development

### Getting Started

- `git clone git@github.com:PeakBI/jedlik.git`
- `yarn`

### Build

- `yarn build` compiles the TypeScript code into a `dist` directory.

### Test

- `yarn test` will run unit and integration tests using Jest. Integration tests run against a Dockerized DynamoDB Local. You'll need the Docker daemon running for this.

### Publish

- Use `yarn version` to increase the package version. Before increasing the version, tests and lint checks will be run. This will add a new git tag - [See here for more info](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/version/#toc-git-tags). There is also a `postversion` script that will push the new version and tags to GitHub.
- Use `yarn publish` to publish the package to the npm registry. Before publishing, tests and lint checks will be run, and the `build` script will be run automatically.
